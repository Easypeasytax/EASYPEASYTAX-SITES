  <h1>GST Return Filing Mistakes to Avoid in 2025</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Missing the Due Dates</h2>
    <p>Late filing attracts penalties and interest. GSTR-1 is due on the 11th, and GSTR-3B by the 20th (staggered by turnover). GSTR-9 is due by 31st December.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Incorrect Reporting in GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B</h2>
    <p>Mismatched data can lead to notices. Ensure B2B, B2C, and credit/debit notes are properly reported.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Claiming Excess ITC</h2>
    <p>Claim only eligible ITC as per GSTR-2B. Overclaims attract reversal with interest. Reconcile 2B with purchase register before filing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Ignoring NIL Returns</h2>
    <p>File NIL returns even if there's no business activity. Not filing affects e-way bill access and compliance score.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Wrong HSN/SAC Codes</h2>
    <p>Incorrect codes can result in wrong tax rates and scrutiny. Ensure correct HSN classification based on turnover.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Mismatch in Books and GST Returns</h2>
    <p>Monthly and year-end reconciliation is essential. Mismatch in GSTR-3B, 1, 2B and books can cause ITC issues.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Not Correcting Errors in Time</h2>
    <p>Amendments are allowed only up to November of the following FY or date of annual return. Correct mistakes early.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Improper E-way Bill Handling</h2>
    <p>E-way bill must match GSTR-1 data. Inaccuracies may lead to detention or penalty during transit.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Non-compliance with QRMP Scheme</h2>
    <p>QRMP taxpayers must file IFF for B2B and quarterly GSTR-3B. Missing IFF affects buyer’s ITC.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>10. Failing to File GSTR-9 or GSTR-9C</h2>
    <p>Mandatory for businesses with turnover > ₹2 Cr (GSTR-9) or ₹5 Cr (GSTR-9C). Non-filing attracts penalties.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Final Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do monthly reconciliation of 1, 3B, 2B vs books</li>
      <li>File returns even when NIL</li>
      <li>Use reliable GST software or a professional</li>
    </ul>
