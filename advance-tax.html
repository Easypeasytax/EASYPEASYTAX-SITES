  <h1>Advance Tax: Who Needs to Pay and When?</h1>

  <p><strong>Advance Tax</strong> refers to the income tax that should be paid in advance instead of a lump sum at the end of the financial year. It applies to taxpayers whose total tax liability is ₹10,000 or more in a financial year. This system is also known as <em>'pay-as-you-earn' tax</em>.</p>

  <h2>Who Needs to Pay Advance Tax?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Salaried Individuals:</strong> If your employer deducts TDS but your total tax liability exceeds ₹10,000 after TDS, you must pay advance tax on the remaining amount.</li>
    <li><strong>Freelancers and Professionals:</strong> Independent professionals such as doctors, lawyers, consultants, and freelancers with taxable income above the threshold must pay advance tax.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Owners:</strong> Any individual running a business must calculate and pay advance tax if their expected total tax is above ₹10,000.</li>
    <li><strong>Senior Citizens (Above 60 Years):</strong> Not required to pay advance tax <em>if they do not have income from business or profession</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When to Pay Advance Tax? (Due Dates)</h2>
  <table>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your estimated total tax for the year is ₹40,000, then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>₹6,000 by June 15</li>
      <li>₹12,000 more (₹18,000 cumulative) by Sept 15</li>
      <li>₹12,000 more (₹30,000 cumulative) by Dec 15</li>
      <li>₹10,000 more (₹40,000 total) by March 15</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>How to Calculate Advance Tax?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Estimate your annual income</li>
    <li>Deduct eligible deductions (Sections 80C, 80D, etc.)</li>
    <li>Calculate tax based on applicable slab</li>
    <li>Subtract TDS already deducted</li>
    <li>If tax due is more than ₹10,000, pay advance tax</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to Pay Advance Tax?</h2>
  <p>You can pay it online via the <a href="https://eportal.incometax.gov.in/iec/foservices/#/e-pay-tax-prelogin/user-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INCOME TAX portal</a> by selecting <strong>Challan 280</strong> under Income Tax (Other Than Companies).</p>

  <h2>What If You Miss the Deadline?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Section 234B:</strong> Interest at 1% per month for shortfall</li>
    <li><strong>Section 234C:</strong> Interest at 1% per month for deferment of installments</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Timely payment helps avoid interest penalties.</strong></p>

  <h2>Final Words</h2>
